This is not meant to be a serious project and os just for my own learning experience.\n\nI have not updated this notebook to include steps from lesson2 on data cleaning and data augmentation.\n\n### The Problem\nOn ground observations are a key part to weather forecasting. Most observations are taken by autonomous systems but there are still a few routine observations that are done manually by a human. One of these is cloud type classification.\n\nThis manual observation is currently done is at major airports around Australia. At these airports one or more highly knowledgeable and accredited aerodrome weather observers is stationed to take manual weather observations on a fixed schedule throughout each day. But, having such specialized observers at all airports all of the time is not cost effective or realistically feasible, especially for remote locations (e.g. uninhabited islands or infrequently used aerodromes). Therefore many of these remote or small areas miss out on observations and perhaps receive lower quality situational awareness and forecasts as a result.\n\n\n### The Solution\nUsing deep learning and image classification techniques to classifying cloud types from photographs seemed to me a very plausible solution to this problem. Therefore, after the Fastai course v5 lecture 1 I thought I'd try to do exactly that using a visual learner example Jeremy provided as my starting point.\n\nThis algorithm uses a resnet and transfer learning as per the original notebook - [is-it-a-bird] -(https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data) but it uses three broad categories of clouds instead of just birds vs forests. These classes were chosen as per the work of Luke Howard in \"Essay of the Modifications of Clouds\" (1803) (https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/corefour).\n\nIn order to create a data set duckduckgo was searched for the terms: cirrus clouds, cumulus clouds, stratus clouds","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# import shutil\n#
